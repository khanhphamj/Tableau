## Introduction

Welcome to my Tableau project! My name is [KhanhPham], and I am excited to present to you my analysis and visualizations using Tableau. This project showcases my skills in data exploration, analysis, and storytelling through interactive visualizations.

## About Me

I am a Data Science with a strong interest in data analytics and visualization. With a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python, data processing, and machine learning, I have leveraged Tableau to uncover insights from complex datasets and present them in a user-friendly manner.

## Project Objectives

In this Tableau project, my main objectives were:

- **Data Exploration**: To delve deep into the dataset, understand its structure, and identify meaningful patterns and trends.

- **Insights Generation**: To derive valuable insights and actionable conclusions from the data through visual representations.

- **Interactive Visualizations**: To create interactive dashboards and visualizations that enable users to explore the data and discover insights on their own.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **/data**: This directory contains the dataset used for the analysis.

- **/notebooks**: This directory includes any Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts used for data preprocessing or cleaning.

- **/images**: This directory holds the screenshots or images of the Tableau visualizations.

- **/docs**: This directory contains additional documentation or resources related to the Tableau project.
